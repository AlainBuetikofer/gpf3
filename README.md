# Geocom Python Framework (GPF) for ArcGIS Pro

The *Geocom Python Framework* or `gpf` provides a set of Python modules that contain tools, helpers, loggers etc. for a more pleasant Python scripting experience in ArcGIS and/or [GEONIS](https://geonis.com/en/solutions/framework/geonis).  
GIS users who need to write geoprocessing scripts with `arcpy` might benefit from importing the `gpf` module into their script as well.

The `gpf` module in this repository has been developed for **Python 3.6+ (ArcGIS Pro, Server)**.
However, it is [also available for 2.7.14+](../../../gpf) (ArcGIS Desktop/Server).  

GIS users who need to write GEONIS menu or form scripts should also check out the [`gntools`](../../../gntools) module.

## Requirements

- ArcGIS Pro 2.2 or higher (or ArcGIS Server)
- Python 3.6 (with `arcpy` module)
