This is the documentation for the **gpf** package for **Python 3.6+**.
For the Python 2.7 version (suitable for ArcGIS Desktop 10.6+), please refer to the **gpf** package.

The **gpf** package contains several subpackages with tools and helpers for all kinds of
ArcGIS-related geoprocessing and data management tasks.
It is released under the Apache License 2.0 as an open-source product,
allowing the community to freely use it, improve it and possibly add new features.

Several tools in this package require Esri's ``arcpy`` Python library, which does not make this a *free* package.
However, users who have already installed and authorized ArcGIS Desktop (ArcMap, ArcCatalog etc.) should be able to work
with this package without any problems.
